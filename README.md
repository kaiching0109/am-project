## UIUX Modification
- Add paddings, margins
- Move Send Message to the right
- Only render Read More Buttons when there is more than 10 messages

## KNOWN BUGS
- READ MORE: acting a bit weird.. (Not quite sure about the expected behavior when there is no messages/already reached latest/oldest)

## TO BE IMPROVED
- eslint config, stylelint should be added
- refactoring needed (GraphQL Query and logic should be moved out from the component)
- add test with Jasmine and Puppeteer
